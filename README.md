Software design

Part I. API Modules
1) Robot (robot.py)
Main function: the only entrance for hardware control
Hardware drivers:
	- XY_platform (using smoothieware, USB)
	- Z_platform (using arduino, USB)
	- E-Pipette (for liquid handling, commericial - Hamilton, RS232)
	- Gripper (for cap handling, commerical, RS485 modbus)
	- Communication (USB to RS232ï¼Œ USB to RS485)
Based these drivers
	- Liquid handler
	- Tablet handler
	- Capper handler
	was builded.
2) Deck (deck.py, create_plate.py)
Main function: Convert user vial/bottle locator (plate, vial) such as ("A1", "B2") to phisical coordinate such as {'x': 0, 'y':10, 'z': 10.3})
	# The deck module gives the cooridinates of all plates and vials placed in the deck
	# It also manages robot config and deck configuration
	# It also create and manages plate definition
	# It also manages calibration data and head offsets

3) Chemical synthesis (synthesis.py)
Function: The chemistry part of project
	- Reagent database management
		- Regent index (using excel file, may use SQL in the future)
	- Reaction protocol management
		- Reaction plan reading (using a txt/csv file, may use a GUI)
		- Convert to a JSON file for execution.
	- Bio modules (for future)

API Interface:
Examples:
	robot.connect()
	robot.pickup_tip()
	robot.transfer_liquid(from = vial1, to = vial2, volume = 100, tip = tip1)
	robot.decap (vial)
	synthesis.load_reagent_index(file)
	synthesis.parse_plan_to_json()

Part II. GUI User interface
	- Tkinter (for now)
	- API calls via robot mudule and chemical synthesis module
